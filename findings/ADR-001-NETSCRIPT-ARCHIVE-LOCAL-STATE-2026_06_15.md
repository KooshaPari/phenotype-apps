# ADR-001 NetScript Archive — Local Work State (2026-06-15 01:38 PDT)

## What was done this turn

1. **Created branch** `chore/adr-001-archive-2026-06-15` in the NetScript submodule at `c144f58c59` → `76f3f3f` (HEAD).
2. **Wrote `NetScript/DEPRECATED.md`** (129 lines) following the
   cheap-llm-mcp DEPRECATED.md pattern. Contents:
   - Status banner (EoL as of 2026-06-15)
   - Why-archived summary (3 factors from ADR-001)
   - What changed (GitHub archived flag, no new crates.io releases, monorepo pointer frozen)
   - What is preserved (source, tests, history, branches, supply-chain artifacts)
   - Downstream action items (consumers, source readers, issue reporters, forks)
   - Deletion timeline (reversible per ADR-002 governance)
   - Verification command (`gh repo view --json isArchived`)
   - References to ADR-001, monorepo, and ADR-011 precedent
3. **Committed** locally as `76f3f3f docs: deprecate NetScript per ADR-001
   (archive on 2026-06-15)` on branch `chore/adr-001-archive-2026-06-15`.

## What is blocked (permission gap)

The `gh` CLI is authenticated as **Dmouse92** (token scopes: `gist`,
`read:org`, `repo`, `workflow`). The NetScript repo is owned by
**KooshaPari**. Three actions require KooshaPari-level permissions:

| Action | Result | Why blocked |
|---|---|---|
| `git push origin chore/adr-001-archive-2026-06-15` | **403 Permission denied** | Dmouse92 cannot push to KooshaPari/NetScript |
| `gh api -X PATCH repos/KooshaPari/NetScript -f archived=true` | **404 Not Found** | Dmouse92 is not an admin/collaborator |
| `gh repo edit KooshaPari/NetScript --archive` | **unknown flag** | gh CLI 2.91.0 has no `--archive` flag for `repo edit` |

The local commit exists; pushing and archiving require either
re-authenticating as KooshaPari (the GitHub owner) or performing
the actions from a session authenticated as KooshaPari.

## What's still needed to complete the archive

The following two actions remain; both require the **KooshaPari** GitHub
identity (not Dmouse92):

### 1. Push the deprecation branch
```bash
cd NetScript
git push -u origin chore/adr-001-archive-2026-06-15
# 403 with Dmouse92; needs KooshaPari or a deploy key
```

### 2. Open a PR and merge to main (or push directly to main)
Per cheap-llm-mcp precedent (`/cheap-llm-mcp/DEPRECATED.md` is on the
EoL branch `archive/final-2026-06-13`), the deprecation marker goes
on the project's `main` branch (or a tagged archive branch). For
NetScript, since the value is "unclear" per ADR-001, the simplest
path is:

- Option A: PR `chore/adr-001-archive-2026-06-15` → `main`, merge, then archive.
- Option B: Tag the current main as `archive/final-2026-06-15`, then archive.

### 3. Archive the GitHub repo
```bash
gh api -X PATCH repos/KooshaPari/NetScript -f archived=true
# requires admin:org or repo admin (Dmouse92 is read-only)
```

After the API call succeeds, the `isArchived` field will be `true` and
the web banner will read "This repository has been archived by the owner.
It is now read-only."

## Verification of the local commit

The local DEPRECATED.md (129 lines) is committed on branch
`chore/adr-001-archive-2026-06-15` at HEAD `76f3f3f`. To verify:

```bash
cd NetScript
git log -1 --stat
# 76f3f3f docs: deprecate NetScript per ADR-001 (archive on 2026-06-15)
#  1 file changed, 129 insertions(+)
#  create mode 100644 DEPRECATED.md
git diff main..HEAD -- DEPRECATED.md | head -5
# shows the new file content
```

The parent monorepo's view of NetScript (in `chore/w1-2-archive-cheap-llm-mcp-2026-06-15`):
- Old pointer: `4e242f266b`
- New pointer: `76f3f3f0ca` (uncommitted — see "Why I didn't update the parent pointer" below)

## Why I didn't update the parent pointer

I deliberately did **not** commit the submodule pointer update in
the parent monorepo. Reasons:

1. **Branch scope mismatch.** The W1-2 branch is
   `chore/w1-2-archive-cheap-llm-mcp-2026-06-15`. Mixing NetScript
   pointer updates into a branch named for cheap-llm-mcp work
   muddles the audit trail.
2. **Reference integrity.** If the W1-2 branch gets pushed
   somewhere, downstream clones would see a NetScript pointer
   referencing commit `76f3f3f` on a branch
   `chore/adr-001-archive-2026-06-15` that exists in my local
   submodule checkout but not on the parent's remote. That would
   create broken submodule references for anyone cloning.
3. **Multi-agent work-in-progress.** The W1-2 branch already has
   168+ dirty submodules from other agents' work. Adding my
   NetScript pointer change would mix concerns further.

When the deprecation work is ready to be merged, the right path
is a fresh branch off main (e.g., `chore/adr-001-netscript-archive-2026-06-15`
in the parent), with the NetScript submodule pointer advanced to
`76f3f3f` (which is on the `chore/adr-001-archive-2026-06-15` branch
in the submodule) and the parent pointer commit co-located.

## Open follow-ups (out of scope for this turn)

- [ ] Re-authenticate `gh` as KooshaPari (or use SSH `~/.ssh/push_key`
      to `github.com`) to push the NetScript branch.
- [ ] Open a NetScript PR or push directly to main, then archive.
- [ ] Decide whether the monorepo's NetScript submodule gets a
      `DEPRECATED.md` mirror or just a pointer advance to the
      archive commit.
- [ ] Update the L6 health audit (last update 2026-06-14) to
      reflect the NetScript archive.

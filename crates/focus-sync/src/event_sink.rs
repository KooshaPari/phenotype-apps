//! Append-side port for normalized events produced by connectors.
//!
//! `SyncOrchestrator` calls [`EventSink::append`] for every event returned
//! by a successful `Connector::sync`. A [`NoopEventSink`] exists so callers
//! that don't wire a real store (tests, CLI dry-runs) still compile; the
//! FFI / iOS path wires an adapter around `focus_storage::EventStore`.
//!
//! Kept in `focus-sync` (not `focus-storage`) to avoid a cross-crate
//! dependency cycle: `focus-ffi` already depends on both.

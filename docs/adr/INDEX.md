## Notes

- This file is **auto-generated** by `scripts/adr_index_gen.py`. Do not edit by hand; the `adr-lint` CI workflow fails if it drifts from the on-disk ADRs.
- The hand-curated **pillar-grouped** view lives at `docs/adr/INDEX-by-pillar.md` (per ADR-024 + ADR-041; cadence: weekly Mon 09:00 PDT).
- ADR numbers may collide across date directories (e.g. ADR-077 in `2026-06-20/` is SLSA, ADR-077 in `2026-06-21/` is Vault). Disambiguation is by file path.
- Cross-references in ADR bodies are validated by `scripts/adr_backlink_check.py` (run on every ADR-touching PR).
